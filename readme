This is the premade website that will ship with the server as soon as a release is out.

To get it up and running:
-Download it (duh)
-Set up a MySQL Server, create the "infrasa" database
-change your db connection settings in /application/config/database.php

That should pretty much be it.
This site runs on the CodeIgniter PHP Framework. If you want to contribute and need any help, 
feel free to just ask and I'll be happy to explain.
